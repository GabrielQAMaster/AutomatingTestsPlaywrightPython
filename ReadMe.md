# ðŸŒŸ Automating Tests with Playwright and Python ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the **AutomatingTestsPlaywrightPython** repository! This project demonstrates how to build robust automated tests using **Playwright** and **Python**, covering multiple testing perspectives for APIs.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Whatâ€™s Inside?

This repository contains various types of automated tests for APIs:

### 1. **Functional Test**
- Validates API functionality based on expected inputs and outputs.
- Ensures the API adheres to its specifications.
- File: `functional_test.py`

### 2. **Security Test**
- Checks for common vulnerabilities in the API.
- Ensures secure communication and proper error handling.
- File: `security_test.py`

### 3. **Load Test**
- Measures the API's ability to handle simultaneous requests.
- Identifies potential bottlenecks under stress conditions.
- File: `load_test.py`

### 4. **Performance Test**
- Evaluates the API's response times and throughput.
- Collects metrics to ensure the API meets performance benchmarks.
- File: `performance_test.py`

### 5. **End-to-End (E2E) Test**
- Simulates a full user workflow, from request to data validation.
- Ensures the API integrates well with other components.
- File: `e2e_test_api.py`
